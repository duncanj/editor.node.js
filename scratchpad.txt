Could proxy with apache, but apparently this causes one thread per request and removes all benefit of node.js.

<VirtualHost 176.34.249.112:80>
  ServerAdmin xyz@176.34.249.112
	ServerName 176.34.249.112
	ServerAlias 176.34.249.112
	ProxyRequests off
	<Proxy *>

		Allow from all

	<Location />
	ProxyPass http://localhost:8150/
	ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:8150/
