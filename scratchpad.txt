Logging with timestamps
=======================
Tried winston, but it didn't seem to work.
There are several date time libraries that look interesting:

	Moment looks the most impressive.


Port 80
=======

Could proxy with apache, but apparently this causes one thread per request and removes all benefit of node.js.

<VirtualHost 176.34.249.112:80>
  ServerAdmin xyz@176.34.249.112
	ServerName 176.34.249.112
	ServerAlias 176.34.249.112
	ProxyRequests off
	<Proxy *>
		Order deny,allow
		Allow from all
	</Proxy>
	<Location />
	ProxyPass http://localhost:8150/
	ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:8150/
</Location>
</VirtualHost>

Went with sudo.  This is probably dangerous and we should use iptables mapping instead.
